Usage:
  snap refresh [refresh-OPTIONS] [<snap>...]

The refresh command updates the specified snaps, or all snaps in the system if
none are specified.

With no further options, the snaps are refreshed to the current revision of the
channel they're tracking, preserving their confinement options.

Revision choice via the --revision override requires the the user to
have developer access to the snap, either directly or through the
store's collaboration feature, and to be logged in (see 'snap help login').

Note a later refresh will typically undo a revision override.

      --color=[auto|never|always]     Use a little bit of color to highlight
                                      some things. (default: auto)
